# English Dictionary

This repository includes a full-scale English dictionary. The data was sourced from an English dictionary which I found on the Gutenberg Project, and the repository includes the book itself. 

I have written code to separate words and meanings into different lists, making it easier to access and manipulate the data. It has been a fun project, and I am excited to share the code.

Additionally, I have developed a web version of the dictionary. You can check it out at [purnorup.com/dictionary](https://purnorup.com/dictionary). Thank you for your interest!
